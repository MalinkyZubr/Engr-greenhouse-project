when a device changes preset, shoul its data be reset? YES!
if it does, then how does the project continue to use that data? There will be just a lot of data sitting around with null device IDs
add an epochs system, so that whenever a device gets update, its epoch increments?
or just leave it to frontend graphs to distinguish between presets
pre-preset change would be one color, active preset will be a different color
